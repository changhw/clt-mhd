# Introduction #
CLT\_MHD: China Lager Toroidal MHD simulation code.
The first version is a fortran code written by Zhe Jiang University Wang Sheng.
I am rewriting it using C++ to make it more modularized, more flexible and more user-friendly.



# Details #

  * Resistivity MHD equations.

  * 3D nonlinear code.

  * With really geometry of tokamaks.
